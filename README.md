# Website
This repository hosts the source code which (eventually) powers my website: https://leonardobishop.com/

The web app runs on NodeJS using [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and renders web pages with [ejs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs). It parses content pages written in a markup language (currently [Wikitext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext)) from the `pages/` directory and renders them as HTML.

## Building
Instructions to build and deploy the web app will be written here whenever it is finished.
