Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm '''Leonardo Bishop''', a programmer studying Computer Science full-time at university.

You can view my projects on the [[about]] page.

== Accessing old content ==

All traffic to leonardobishop.com is now redirected to this new website. To access old content on here, you should prepend the path with a tilde (~).

For example, the following
<pre>
https://leonardobishop.com/nextbus/
</pre>
will become
<pre>
https://leonardobishop.com/~nextbus/
</pre>

== New website ==

This new website is built in NodeJS and these pages are witten in wikitext.

The source code for this website is available on [https://github.com/LMBishop/website GitHub], for everyone to rip apart and laugh at how poorly written it is. (If you do have suggestions on how to improve it though, please do let me know!)
