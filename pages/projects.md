# Projects

I'm [LMBishop on GitHub](https://github.com/LMBishop), where I have quite a few
repositories of varying quality. Some of the better ones are:

* [Quests](https://github.com/LMBishop/Quests), a plugin for Minecraft servers
  which lets you create objectives and missions for players to complete.
* [/spotify](/spotify), so I can share what I'm
  listening to at this very moment. Though it's still a work in progress, and
  the actual repository for it is the same one as this website.
* If you're a Linux nerd then maybe my 
  [dotfiles](https://github.com/LMBishop/dotfiles) are of interest to you.
