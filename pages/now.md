# Now

Learning Rust. Trying to understand the hype.

Working on [murder](https://github.com/LMBishop/murder), a port of the classic 
gmod game mode by Mechanical Mind for [s&box](https://sbox.facepunch.com/).

Trying to expand the number of things I can Actually Cook.

Enjoying the relative freedom and lack of stress during the few weeks I have 
after the end of semester, and before my year long placement.
