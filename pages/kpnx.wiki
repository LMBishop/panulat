'''KPNX''', [[virtual channel]] 12 ([[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] [[digital terrestrial television|digital]] channel 18), is an [[NBC]]-[[network affiliate|affiliated]] [[television station]] serving [[Phoenix, Arizona]], United States that is [[city of license|licensed]] to the suburb of [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]]. The station is owned by [[McLean, Virginia]]-based [[Tegna Inc.]] KPNX's studios are located at the Republic Media building on [[Van Buren Street (Arizona)|Van Buren Street]] in [[downtown Phoenix]] (which also houses formerly co-owned newspaper ''[[The Arizona Republic]]''), and its transmitter is located atop [[South Mountains (Arizona)|South Mountain]] on the city's south side; it is also broadcast on [[KNAZ-TV]] (channel 2) in [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]], which formerly was a separate NBC affiliate, and a network of [[Low-power broadcasting#Television|low-power]] [[Broadcast relay station#Broadcast translators|translators]] across northern and central Arizona.

Channel 12 was the second TV station on the air in the Phoenix area, starting in 1953. Originally established in Mesa itself, it was acquired by Phoenix radio station [[KTAR (AM)|KTAR (620 AM)]] in 1954 in a maneuver that ended a contest over channel 3 in Phoenix and was co-owned with that outlet for 25 years. It has been owned by Tegna and its predecessor, Gannett, since 1979, when it became KPNX.

The [[Federal Communications Commission]] granted the construction permit on February 18, 1953.<ref name="okay">{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/85829727/|title=KTYL Given Okay To Build TV Station|work=[[The Arizona Republic]]|page=1|date=February 19, 1953|access-date=September 23, 2021|archive-date=September 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210925044446/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/85829727/ktyl-given-okay-to-build-tv-station/|url-status=live}}</ref> At the end of March 1953, the city of Phoenix's parks board approved a [[South Mountains (Arizona)|South Mountain]] transmitter, reversing an earlier decision that would have denied television stations not licensed to Phoenix the use of the site and which was protested by television set owners who wanted to be assured reception of all stations from one site.<ref name="parks">{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/32885335/|title=South Mountain TV Site Granted Mesa Station: KTYL Gets City Parks Board Okay|first=Orren|last=Beaty|work=The Arizona Republic|date=April 1, 1953|page=1|access-date=September 23, 2021|archive-date=September 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210925044434/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/32885335/ktyl-gets-city-parks-board-okay/|url-status=live}}</ref>

With the site approved by the FCC and the city of Phoenix, construction began nearly immediately.

Lurking under the embryonic Phoenix television landscape was the absence of one of the state's pioneer radio stations. In 1948, [[KTAR (AM)|KTAR]] (620 AM) had filed for Phoenix's channel 3, only to see the FCC plunge television applications into a four-year-long freeze. As early as 1945, KTAR had arranged for exclusive rights to the South Mountain space that would later be used by all of the Phoenix TV stations as a transmitter site—a concession that was overturned in the run-up to KTYL-TV's launch.{{r|parks}} When the freeze was lifted in 1952, KTAR declared it would be on the air within three months of a construction permit grant, having already selected a site for and broken ground on a proposed television and radio studio at Central Avenue and Portland Street and contracted for equipment to furnish it.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/85830443/2-new-stations-planned-as-us-ends-tv-f/|title=2 New Stations Planned As U.S. Ends TV Freeze|pages=1, [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/85830492/two-new-phoenix-tv-stations-planned-as-t/ 2]|work=The Arizona Republic|date=April 14, 1952|access-date=September 23, 2021|archive-date=September 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210925044435/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/85830443/2-new-stations-planned-as-us-ends-tv/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/85849305/|first=Henry|last=Fuller|work=The Arizona Republic|title=KTAR Marks 30th Anniversary As New Station Project Begins|date=June 15, 1952|page=II:6|access-date=September 23, 2021|archive-date=September 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210925044436/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/85849305/ktar-marks-30th-anniversary-as-new/|url-status=live}}</ref> It was speculated that [[KPHO-TV]] owner [[Meredith Corporation]]—whose station was the only pre-freeze outlet in the state—might have decided to let KTYL-TV have NBC because of the sense that, as soon as KTAR won a television station, it would sign up with NBC, mirroring the radio station.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/85830286/networks-split-made-official/|first=Maggie|last=Wilson|title=Networks Split Made Official|page=3:6|work=The Arizona Republic|date=April 30, 1953|access-date=September 23, 2021|archive-date=September 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210925044435/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/85830286/networks-split-made-official/|url-status=live}}</ref>

However, KTAR's channel 3 picture became cloudy in February 1953, just as the FCC was about to hand down a decision. A new applicant, the Arizona Television Company, filed for the channel.{{r|okay}} This applicant added a major power broker to its ranks months later: [[Ernest McFarland]], former senator and soon to be governor.<ref>{{Cite news |date=May 31, 1953 |title=McFarland Joins in TV Station |page=3 |via=Newspapers.com |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/63264150/ |url-status=live |access-date=November 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210630063733/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/63264150/mcfarland-joins-in-tv-station/ |archive-date=June 30, 2021}}</ref> In February 1954, hearings were held on the channel 3 assignment.<ref>{{Cite news |date=February 25, 1954 |title=TV Hearings Open Tomorrow |page=35 |work=The Arizona Republic |via=Newspapers.com |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/63264365/ |url-status=live |access-date=November 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210630063808/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/63264365/tv-hearings-open-tomorrow/ |archive-date=June 30, 2021}}</ref>

The channel 3 contest ended in April 1954, when KTAR announced it would buy KTYL-TV for $250,000, a decision that cleared the way for the Arizona Television Company to build [[KTVK]].<ref name="announced">{{Cite news |date=April 30, 1954 |title=Purchase Of KTYL-TV By KTAR Announced |page=1 |work=The Arizona Republic |via=Newspapers.com |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/44184548/ |url-status=live |access-date=November 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210630063709/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/44184548/purchase-of-ktyl-tv-by-ktar-announced/ |archive-date=June 30, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=May 5, 1954 |title=KTYL-TV Tag $250,000 |page=22 |work=The Arizona Republic |via=Newspapers.com |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/63264666/ |url-status=live |access-date=November 14, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210630063718/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/63264666/ktyl-tv-tag-250000/ |archive-date=June 30, 2021}}</ref> In announcing the purchase, KTAR owner John J.

In 1968, the Louis family's KTAR and Eller Outdoor Advertising, owned by [[Karl Eller]], merged into Combined Communications Corporation.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/85830670/ad-agency-broadcast-merger-okd/|title=Ad agency, broadcast merger OKd|page=2-B|work=The Arizona Republic|date=October 18, 1968|access-date=September 23, 2021|archive-date=September 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210925044436/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/85830670/ad-agency-broadcast-merger-okd/|url-status=live}}</ref> Combined then grew into owning other television and radio stations and owned a full complement of seven by 1974, when it merged with Pacific & Southern Broadcasting Company.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1973/1973-04-23-BC.pdf|date=April 23, 1973|work=Broadcasting|title=P&S goes under wing of CCC|pages=22–23|access-date=September 23, 2021|archive-date=March 8, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308035417/https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1973/1973-04-23-BC.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1978, Combined Communications agreed to merge with the [[Gannett|Gannett Company]]. The merged company opted to retain channel 12 and divest the Phoenix radio stations;<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/85850336/combined-communications-and-gannett-co/|title=Combined Communications and Gannett Co. to merge|first=Joe|last=Cole|page=1|date=May 9, 1978|work=The Arizona Republic|access-date=September 23, 2021|archive-date=September 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210925044437/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/85850336/combined-communications-and-gannett-co/|url-status=live}}</ref> Combined's ownership of the KTAR stations had been [[grandfather clause|grandfathered]] earlier in the decade when the FCC forbade common ownership of television and radio stations in top-50 markets, but with the Gannett merger, the KTAR cluster lost its grandfathered protection.

From 1977 to 1995, KPNX was run by general manager C.E.

The fact that KPNX was the only Phoenix station unaffected by a major realignment of network affiliations in 1994 and 1995 fueled a run of success for KPNX and its news department that lasted more than a decade.

KPNX was retained by the broadcasting company, which took the name [[Tegna Inc.|Tegna]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Separation of Gannett into two public companies completed {{!}} TEGNA|url = http://www.tegna.com/separation-of-gannett-into-two-public-companies-completed/|publisher = Tegna|access-date = June 29, 2015|archive-date = July 2, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150702005302/http://www.tegna.com/separation-of-gannett-into-two-public-companies-completed/|url-status = live}}</ref> KPNX and ''The Republic'' continue to operate in the same building as separate entities; as a consequence of the split, KPNX regained a separate website, having shared azcentral.com with the newspaper.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/blog/business/2015/07/divorce-separate-bedrooms-and-bed-bugs-breaking.html|work=Phoenix Business Journal|first=Mike|last=Sunnucks|title=Divorce, separate bedrooms and bedbugs: Breaking down the Gannett breakup for 'Arizona Republic,' KPNX|date=July 6, 2015|access-date=September 24, 2021|archive-date=September 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210925044612/https://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/blog/business/2015/07/divorce-separate-bedrooms-and-bed-bugs-breaking.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

KTAR-TV was the Phoenix pioneer of the so-called "happy talk" news format when it reformatted its newscasts under the ''[[Action News]]'' format in late 1973,<ref>{{cite news|first=Thomas|last=Goldthwaite|title=The TV news tease|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/85888605/|work=The Arizona Republic|page=B-11|date=November 7, 1973|access-date=September 24, 2021|archive-date=September 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210925044551/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/85888605/the-tv-news-tease/|url-status=live}}</ref> with longtime anchor Ray Thompson paired alongside Bob Hughes, weatherman Dewey Hopper (last with [[Air America Radio]] affiliate [[KPHX]] and a longtime weather forecaster in Sacramento) and sportscaster Ted Brown.

In 1994, KPNX was the only station unaffected by a major realignment of network affiliations in the Phoenix market. This status and the strength of NBC in the late 1990s helped to catalyze a decade of ratings success for channel 12, which put together nearly 50 consecutive ratings book wins at 10 p.m. from 1996 to 2007, even while NBC's ratings faltered toward the end of the run.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nexttv.com/news/phoenix-risingfast-83393|first=Michael|last=Malone|title=Phoenix Rising—Fast|work=Broadcasting & Cable|date=July 27, 2007|access-date=September 24, 2021|archive-date=January 24, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210124193101/https://www.nexttv.com/news/phoenix-risingfast-83393|url-status=live}}</ref> It was the first station in the state to convert its news production to high definition in 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.twice.com/news/local-news-making-switch-hd-21352|work=TWICE|first=Allison|last=Romano|title=Local News Is Making Switch To HD|date=January 3, 2007|access-date=September 24, 2021|archive-date=January 17, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210117010131/https://www.twice.com/news/local-news-making-switch-hd-21352|url-status=live}}</ref>
